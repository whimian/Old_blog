From the expierences of others' , I got to know that's not easy.But that won't make me step back.I know New York is one of the biggest city of the world , and there're millions people, but how many of them do live there,most of them just work there,New York is a place to live but a place whre you make your dreams come true. New York is the richest city in the world,but&nbsp;not everybody there is having&nbsp;a very good life, everybody is seeking a good life. They spare no efforts&nbsp;to do their job, to make money ,to creat their own life ,every New Yorker is on the way to their dream. Maybe some 'noble man'think&nbsp;life in&nbsp;New York unsignificant ,it's all about matieral. I wanna tell&nbsp;those guy, it's not about&nbsp;matieral, but,about dreams. Hard working and dreams coming true, that is the spirit of&nbsp;City and all New Yorkers.</p> 
<p>At this moment millions of New Yorkers&nbsp;are&nbsp;doing their job, I really&nbsp;wanna join them, and that'll make my life significant.&nbsp;</p>
