Title: week one of March
Date: 2017-03-04 11:22

<p>I came back to college from home as late as possible, which is just like on every end of winter vacations. The work of the project took up most of the week, but still no promising progress was made.</p> 
<p><br /></p> 
<p>Not being able to graduate in due time keeps bothering me all week, flooding me with visions of a miserable future of my life. lol.</p> 
<p><br /></p> 
<p>And I am out of a bad relationship, which should have ended a year ago, by the way.<br /></p>
